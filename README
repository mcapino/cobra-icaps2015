Decentralized Multi-robot Planning
==================================

Compiling
---------
The dependencies are managed using Maven. To compile the project and create a jar archive with dependencies run:	

$ mvn package

The jar archive with all dependencies will be in:

target/admap-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Alternatively, you can open the project in your favorite IDE, i.e. in Eclipse.

Getting started
---------------

The planners are run through cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator class. 

Parameters:
  -problemfile 		Path to an xml file with problem description.
  -method			Specifies method to be used to solve the problem. One of {PP, RPP, SDPP, SDRPP, ADPP, ADRPP, ORCA}.
  -maxtime			Specifies the maximum time considered during trajectory planning.
  -timestep			The discretization of time-dimension used during trajectory planning.
  -showvis          Turns on/off the visualization.
  
Detailed information can be derived from the source code, in particular from the method cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator.createFromArgs().  

Example: 
--------

	Tshe following command will run the ADRPP on the example problem instance described in file problems/ubremen-n15.xml.

	$ java -jar target/admap-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar cz.agents.admap.creator.ScenarioCreator -problemfile problems/ubremen-n15.xml -method ADRPP -maxtime 15000 -timestep 45 -showvis

Visualization control: 
----------------------

When the visualization window pops-up, use the following keys to toggle various useful visualization layers:
  m - missions/tasks of agents
  t - trajectories of agents
  g - planning graph
  c - conflicts between trajectories (may slow down the visualization if toggled on)
  p - polygons representing obstacles 
  
The movement of agents can be simulated by pressing (and holding) the following keys:
  q - move time forwards
  a - move time backwards
  <space> - reset time to 0
  
Dragging with right mouse button pressed moves the viewport. Mouse wheel zooms the view.
